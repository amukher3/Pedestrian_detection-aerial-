# Pedestrian_detection-aerial-
Detecting pedestrian/people from aerial imagery/footage using Mobile net SSD.

***Goal and Description***: This repo. is an effort to detect pedestrians from `aerial and street cam. imagery`. A pre-trained `Mobile Net SSD` is used to detect the pedestrians.

***Motivation***: The motivation behind this effort is to count people/pedestrian from drone/street cam. images during the days of pandemic. This project gives a major boost to efforts to reduce people on the streets and in public places during the days of social distancing.

Playing with the _blob size_ might hold the key for better results.
